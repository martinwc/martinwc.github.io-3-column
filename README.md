## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements



## My process

started using HTML and build up the foundation of the page. Then used css properties and created a 3 column template. I first started off building for desktop viewing and then used @media queries to make it responsive to mobile viewing. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using Grid template columns was a challenge. After some self research, I was able to figure out how to use grid template columns correctly and implement to the page. 

### Continued development

Continue to work on CSS grid columns and implement a more responsive website
